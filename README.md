# Fake News Detection using AI

In contemporary times, the proliferation of misinformation across digital platforms underscores the imperative to combat fake news. Addressing this exigency, the project titled "Fake News Detection Using AI" endeavors to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies.

The project commences with an acknowledgment of the intricate nature of textual data and the attendant challenges posed to accurate analysis. To surmount this hurdle, advanced text preprocessing techniques, notably stemming, are employed to standardize and normalize the textual corpus. By effectuating the reduction of words to their root forms, stemming engenders heightened efficiency in subsequent analytical processes and augments the system's capacity for feature extraction.

Building upon this foundational preprocessing step, the project integrates two pivotal vectorization methodologies: Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer. Count Vectorizer transmutes textual documents into numerical matrices delineating the frequency of each word therein. Conversely, TF-IDF Vectorizer computes the significance of individual words vis-Ã -vis the entire corpus, factoring in both their prevalence within the document and rarity across the corpus. These vectorization techniques facilitate the representation of textual data in a format amenable to machine learning algorithms.

In terms of classification algorithms, the project harnesses two prominent models: decision tree and Naive Bayes. These algorithms are adeptly suited for text classification tasks and furnish a robust foundation for the fake news detection system. To optimize performance, RandomizedSearchCV is employed for hyperparameter tuning. This method adeptly traverses the hyperparameter space, discerning optimal parameter configurations for the classifiers and thereby enhancing model accuracy.

Evaluation constitutes a pivotal facet of the project, with accuracy serving as the metric for gauging system efficacy. This metric quantifies the proportion of correctly classified instances, affording valuable insights into system performance. Through ongoing evaluation and refinement endeavors, the project aspires to achieve heightened accuracy in the identification of fake news articles, thereby mitigating the prevalence of false positives.

Ultimately, the project endeavors to contribute to the collective endeavor of combating misinformation and safeguarding the integrity of information dissemination within the digital milieu. By harnessing the potential of AI and machine learning modalities, it endeavors to equip stakeholders with the requisite tools to discern between credible and spurious sources, fostering a more enlightened and resilient societal fabric.
